<strong> Love </strong> is a great driving force of mankind.

There are those who say they can appreciate it, but there are also those who have <b>suffered </b> from it.

<strong> Data Science </strong> has been an important tool used to solve many problems.

Therefore, would it be possible to understand <b>Love</b> from it?

I don't have such answer, but I share a little joke made during my <strong> Python studies </strong>.

Perhaps, both <b>Love & Data Science</b> aren't that complicated at all.💙
